<h1>Discrepancies Between Subjective and Objective Evaluations of NYC School Performance</h1>
By: Michelle Choi, Yichen Guan, and Samantha Udolf

<h2> Overview and Motivation </h2>
Though the Department of Education (DOE) is responsible for providing funding and overseeing regulation for all New York City public schools, the resulting performance of these academic institutions varies widely across the city. Unfortunately, these trends are not entirely unexpected given that the DOE has only limited resources that it must allocate amongst its crowded school district. Since access to education is absolutely essential in improving quality of life, our motivation for this project was to investigate which factors contributed most to an enhanced educational experience. In particular, since policymakers and government officials have the most influence over resource allocation amongst and within such schools, we sought to analyze school performance in a manner that would inform these stakeholders how to shape educational reform to affect the most beneficial change. In other words, our goal was to analyze different factors hypothesized to contribute to enhanced education quality to isolate which variables were most strongly correlated with positive results. This analysis is critical because, equipped with this information, educational policymakers would have a better understanding of how to allocate their limited resources by prioritizing reforms that are most strongly correlated with improved performance. Motivated by this goal, our project aims to produce an interactive tool that would allow users to toggle different factors influencing educational outcomes to estimate the success of policies aimed to reform particular parts of the school system.

From our initial research, we quickly found that factors such as class size and program funding have consistently been found to improve school performance. While we found strong arguments demonstrating the correlation between such variables with school performance, we felt that existing knowledge could be improved by a better understanding of a comparative analysis between such factors. In other words, our project seeks to find the relative effect of each factor’s contribution to educational success compared to other major influences. Moreover, we wanted to investigate whether other variables that have been subject to far less scrutiny, such as surrounding crime rates or age of school (i.e. duration of existence), play just as large of a role in educational performance as more well-researched variables do.

Finally, in discussing how to evaluate school performance, we realized that schools receive both objective and subjective feedback and that it is difficult to determine whether such results align. Hence we decided to whether various factors influence both objective (i.e. test scores) and subjective (i.e. survey taken by teachers or parents about school performance) results, and in turn study whether the results for both types of evaluations are similar.

<h2> Related Work </h2>
Our motivation for this project stemmed from the unanimous sentiment amongst our group members that existing problems in the education system had persisted for far too long without proper reform. In particular, the 2010 film Waiting for “Superman” struck our attention since it revealed astonishing inefficiencies in the United States’ Department of Education that we felt required immediate attention. In fact, the film’s emphasis on the rampant inequality and poor teacher incentive structures helped us realize that many of the system’s flaws could be easily addressed through more informed policy decisions. As a result, we felt inspired to utilize the skills we developed during CS109 to perform a deeper analysis on an issue we felt warranted more thorough investigation given its long-term implications for the wellbeing and productivity of the country’s youth.

While searching for data on this subject matter, we came across a project designed for a CS171 assignment that helped guide our approach to the problem. The project’s citations included a list of references that guided us to the New York City Open Data website, which we used as a starting point to gather our datasets. Though we used some of the data from this source to find math scores for various schools, we did independent research to find sources for data regarding demographic, safety, and funding information for NYC schools. Moreover, we used the NYC Open Data source to find our data for other variables but did not use the same datasets as the CS171 project did; this is because our project was analyzed 2011-2012 (the only year where we could find data for our our variables of interest) instead of the 2010-2011 data the CS171 project used, and we needed data for each school rather than for districts or bureau levels. Finally, though the CS171 project’s focus on education aligned with our general interest, we approached the problem slightly differently in that we aimed to inform policy makers where to invest to improve school outcomes while the CS171 project targeted parents looking for schools for their children as stakeholders. In summary, while the CS171 project helped guide our approach towards considering potential variables and finding data, we did not use it to inform our analysis because the CS171 project only visualized existing trends while ours had a more analytical purpose of identifying factors that could improve school performance.

<h2> Initial Questions and Project Focus Development </h2>
Based on accessible data, we decided to investigate seven independent variables including school type (i.e. charter vs. public), class size, demographic breakdown (i.e. race and gender), school safety (i.e. crime rates in surrounding areas) and funding. The dependent variables included math test scores and survey data (i.e. evaluations of school performances by teachers, students, and parents). Given these variables, our initial goal was to answer the following questions:

<ul>How do the different independent variables interact (ex. what is the interaction between funding and class size)?</ul>

Do the independent variables have a different correlation with the subjective and objective dependent variables? In other words, do high test scores correspond with positive survey results in the same schools?

Which independent variables have the largest effect on each of the dependent variables? How should policymakers prioritize reforms aimed at influencing each of these independent variables?

After deciding to compare different types of regression models and predictive analysis in our final report, we also decided to investigate the following questions:

Which regression model best fits our data? In other words, which regression model has the lowest RMSE when trained on a sample data subset and then tested on the rest of the data?

For the best-fit regression, is there a correlation between the independent variables and school’s test scores or survey data? What is the variation among each variable?

Which combination of independent variables values results in the optimal school performance (what variables are statistically significant)?
